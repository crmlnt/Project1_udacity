The call comes as a new international consortium of researchers urges faster action on clinical research in countries with weak health systems — and offers to help coordinate the process so that researchers from Africa can more easily join.</cite> </p>
                <p>Of the more than 300 clinical trials that have launched to find a treatment for COVID-19, most are in China and South Korea. And more are on the way in the European Union and the United States. But very few are taking place in Africa, Latin America and south and southeast Asia — where the virus could surge next. Trials need to be conducted in low-income countries for several reasons that experts cite. For example, patients in these countries can have different underlying conditions and it is important to know if they respond to drugs differently, compared with those in higher income nations.</p>

                    The World Health Organization says it wants many more African nations to participate in its SOLIDARITY trial, a global study of four potential COVID-19 treatments. The call comes as a new international consortium of researchers urges faster action on clinical research in countries with weak health systems — and offers to help coordinate the process so that researchers from Africa can more easily join.

                    “The situation is that we are running out of time,” warns Nathalie Strub-Wourgaft of the the Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative (DNDi), a non-profit research organization based in Geneva. The DNDi is a member of the new COVID-19 Clinical Research Coalition that launched on 2 April. The consortium comprises universities and research organizations around the world, as well as philanthropic research-funding organizations, including the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in Seattle, Washington, and Wellcome in London.</p>
